"""Merge one pack run's registry tree into the registry repository.

The registry repository holds published versions: a release adds its version
directories under <owner>/<package>/ and leaves every earlier version in
place, so a consumer pinned to an older version still resolves. The registry
tool reads the whole tree and lists every version it finds, so the site shows
the history and the newest release together.

Usage:
    merge-registry-tree.py --tree <registry-tree> --owner <owner> --registry <clone>
    merge-registry-tree.py --selftest

For every repository directory under <tree>/<owner> the merge copies the
repository level files (README.md) over the clone and replaces
<clone>/<owner>/<repo>/<version> in full for every version directory the run
names. Version directories the run does not name, and repositories it does
not name, stay untouched. Re-running the same release writes the same bytes,
so the commit stays empty.

Exit status: 0 merged, 1 a malformed tree, 2 a misconfigured invocation.
