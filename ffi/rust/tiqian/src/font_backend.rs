//! Font backend vtable protocol types (ADR 0050 `PackedFfiCalls`).
//!
//! The layout engine is a Kotlin/Native static library that calls the host
//! font session through the vtable declared in
//! `shaping/api/src/nativeInterop/cinterop/tiqian_font_backend.h`. This module
//! mirrors that header; the two must stay byte-compatible. The protocol
//! revision constant below is a pure-Rust mirror of the single source
//! (engine-haxe/src/org/tiqian/protocol/Revision.hx, boring cutover
//! Stage1-P4): this crate stays header-free (build.rs only links the
//! engine archive), so the mirror is pinned to the generated value by the
//! drift assertion in the precompute engine crate
//! (schema.rs `c_abi_mirrors_match_the_single_source`). The engine-side
//! buffer reader and the Rust-side writer in [`crate::shape_buffer`] share the
//! offsets documented there.
//!
//! The `unsafe extern "C" fn` types below are declarations that match the
//! Kotlin-side C function pointer signatures. They mark the callbacks'
//! callability and run nothing by themselves; obligations are listed in
//! docs/rust-unsafe-inventory.md, section "font_backend.rs".
